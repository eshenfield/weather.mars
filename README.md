## An exploration into the environment of our red-colored neighbor for curious Marsophiles ##

Weather.mars is a weather app for Mars. Using data from the Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System, this app shows the current weather on Mars and allows the user to search for the weather on Mars at any date available in the past. You can also search for a solar day that the Curiosity rover was on Mars and see the pictures it took on that day.

It's tough to visualize the cosmos. Even our near neighbors in the solar system often seem abstract and very far away (which, they are). Making connections between the planets around us and earth through a familiar platform like a weather app helps to remove some of the abstraction of the world outside our atmosphere.
